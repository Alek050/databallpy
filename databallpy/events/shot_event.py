class ShotEvent(IndividualOnBallEvent):
    """Class for shot events, inherits from BaseEvent. Saves all information from a
    shot from the event data, and adds information about the shot using the tracking
    data if available.

     Args:
        event_id (int): distinct id of the event
        period_id (int): id of the period
        minutes (int): minute in which the event occurs
        seconds (int): seconds within the aforementioned minute where the event occurs
        datetime (pd.Timestamp): datetime at which the event occured
        start_x (float): x coordinate of the start location of the event
        start_y (float): y coordinate of the start location of the event
        team_id (int): id of the team that performed the event
        team_side (str): side of the team that performed the event, either
            ["home", "away"]
        pitch_size (tuple): size of the pitch in meters
        player_id (int | str): id of the player that performed the event
        jersey (int): jersey number of the player that performed the event
        outcome (bool): whether the event was successful or not
        related_event_id (int | str | None): id of the event that the event is related
            to the current event.
        body_part (str): body part that the event is related to. Should be in
            databallpy.utils.constants.DATBALLPY_BODY_PARTS
        possession_type (str): type of possession that the event is related to.
            Should be in databallpy.utils.constants.DATABALLPY_POSSESSION_TYPES
        set_piece (str): type of set piece that the event is related to. Should be in
            databallpy.utils.constants.DATABALLPY_SET_PIECES
        outcome_str (str): whether the shot is a goal or not on target or not.
            Should be in databallpy.utils.constants.DATABALLPY_SHOT_OUTCOMES
        y_target (float, optional): y location of the goal. Defaults to np.nan.
        z_target (float, optional): z location of the goal. Defaults to np.nan.
        first_touch (bool, optional): whether the shot is taken with the first touch.
            Defaults to False.
        ball_goal_distance (float, optional): distance between the ball and the goal.
            Defaults to np.nan.
        shot_angle (float, optional): angle of the shot. Defaults to np.nan.
        

    Properties:
        xt (float): expected threat of the event. This is calculated using a model
            that is trained on the distance and angle to the goal, and the distance
            times theangle to the goal. See the notebook in the notebooks folder for
            more information on the model.
        base_df_attributes (list[str]): list of attributes that are used to create a
            DataFrame
        xg (float): expected goals of the shot. This is calculated using a model that is
            trained on the distance and angle to the goal, and the distance times the
            angle to the goal. See the notebook in the notebooks folder for more
            information on the model.

    Returns:
        ShotEvent: instance of the ShotEvent class

    Note:
        For opta event data, the related event id is not the "event_id" of the
        event data, but the "opta_id" in the event data, since opta uses different ids.
