# databallpy

A package for loading, preprocessing, vizualising and synchronizing soccer event- and tracking data.

This package is developed to create a standardized way to analyse soccer matches using both event- and tracking data. Other packages, like [kloppy](https://github.com/PySport/kloppy) and [floodlight](https://github.com/floodlight-sports/floodlight), already standardize the import of data sources. The current package goes a step further in combining different data streams from the same match. In this case, the `Match` object combines information from the event and tracking data.

### Changelog for version 0.3.0

- Added way to save Match objects, and to load saved Match objects
- Fixed bug in opta event data, own goals are now parsed as seperate event type
- Added parser for Inmotio tracking data
- Added parser for Instat event data
- Added quality checks for the data, raises warning if quality is not good enough

### Planned changes

- Adding different filters to filter the tracking data
- Adding features to quantify pressure, ball possession, etc. (if you have any ideas/requests, please open an issue!)
- Standardizing events in the event data
- Adding expected passing and goals models

## Installation

```bash
$ pip install databallpy
```

## Usage

The package is centered around the `Match` object. A `Match` has tracking data, event data metadata about the match.
For a more elaborate example, see the [example file](https://databallpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example.html)

```console
$ from databallpy import get_match, get_open_match
$
$ match = get_match(
$   tracking_data_loc="../data/tracking_data.dat",
$   tracking_metadata_loc="../data/tracking_metadata.xml",
$   tracking_data_provider="tracab"
$   event_data_loc="../data/event_data_f24.xml",
$   event_metadata_loc="../data/event_metadata_f7.xml",
$   event_data_provider="opta",
$ )
$
$ # or to load an open metrica dataset of tracking and event data
$ match = get_open_match()
$
$ match.home_team_name # the team name of the home playing team
$ match.away_players # pandas dataframe with the names, ids, shirt numbers and positions of the away team
$ match.tracking_data # pandas dataframe with tracking data of the match
$ match.event_data # pandas dataframe with event data of the match
```

See [the documentation](https://databallpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/autoapi/databallpy/match/index.html) of the `Match` object and the [example usage](https://databallpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example.html) for more options. Note that this package is developed to combine event and tracking data, for now both datastreams are necessary to create a `Match` object.

## Synchronization of tracking and event data

Tracking and event data is often poorly synchronized. For instance, when taking the event data of Opta and tracking data of Tracab, you can sync the fist frame with the kick-off pass. Now you can sync the other events with the tracking data based on the time difference between the event and the kick off pass. If you do this, how get something like this:

As you can see, the timing (and placing) of the events do not correspond good with the tracking data locations, especially when events follow up quickly or around shots. Using the methodology of [this](https://kwiatkowski.io/sync.soccer) article, this package is able to synchronize tracking and event data using the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm. 

After running the following command, the events are better synchronized to the tracking data:

```batch
$ match.synchronise_tracking_and_event_data()
```
